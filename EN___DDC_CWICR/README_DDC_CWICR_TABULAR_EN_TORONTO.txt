ABOUT THE DATABASE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The modern construction industry in Eurasia and the Asia-Pacific region relies on a unified ecosystem of technical standardization that serves as a common engineering language for more than 10 dynamically developing economies.

The DDC CWICR database (Construction Work Items, Components & Resources) is an attempt to harmonize standards, creating a seamless regulatory space for capital project management across multiple languages. The database covers the full spectrum of construction work: from earthworks and concrete to specialized installation operations.


DATA SOURCES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DDC CWICR is built on official construction cost standards from Eurasian countries that are publicly available. The database was developed in close collaboration with estimators and construction specialists from different countries, which allowed us to take into account practical aspects of working with data. The data has been systematized into a unified structure, harmonized methodologically, and presented in 9 language versions and 9 regional pricing versions for international use.


HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The methodology of resource-based standardization of construction work has been continuously developing and improving since the 1920s — from the first production norms to modern digital reference books. Over a century, the system has evolved from manual calculations to machine-readable databases while preserving the fundamental principle: accurate recording of physical resources per unit of construction output.

The modern version integrates historical data with current market prices. In local markets, similar systems are adapted and known under national codes: ENIR, GESN, FER, NRR, ESN, AzDTN, ShNQK, MKS ChT, SNT, BNbD, Dinh Muc, Ding'e.


RESOURCE-BASED COSTING METHODOLOGY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The key value of Resource-Based Costing is the separation of unchanging production technology from the volatile financial component: it is based on the physical "first principles" of construction — standard norms for labor costs, machine time, and material consumption. These norms remain virtually unchanged regardless of which country the construction is carried out in.

This enables transparent pricing, eliminates hidden markups, and allows for Deep-Dive Audit of investments. As a result, DDC CWICR serves not just as a reference book, but as a fundamental risk management tool that has become the de facto industry standard for the macro-region over the past century.
